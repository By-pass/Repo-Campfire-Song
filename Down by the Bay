Down by the bay - Raffi

Down by the bay 
Where the watermelons grow 
Back to my home 
I dare not go 
For if I do 
My mother will say 
"Did you ever you ever see a goose
kissing a moose?" 
Down by the bay

Down by the bay 
Where the watermelons grow 
Back to my home 
I dare not go 
For if I do 
My mother will say 
"Did you ever see a whale 
With a polka dot tail?" 
Down by the bay

Down by the bay 
Where the watermelons grow 
Back to my home 
I dare not go 
For if I do 
My mother will say 
"Did you ever see a lama
driving a taxi?" 
Down by the bay

Down by the bay 
Where the watermelons grow 
Back to my home 
I dare not go 
For if I do 
My mother will say 
"Did you ever see a sloth
moving fast as cheetah?" 
Down by the bay...

Down by the bay 
Where the watermelons grow 
Back to my home 
I dare not go 
For if I do 
My mother will say 
"Did you ever get hit by a  
lightning speed sleepers?" 
Down by the bay...
